#Easy Kext Installer for Hackintosh:::

This is A Simple and Fast Ever Kext Installer and Repair Permissions for OS X Yosemite and Other OS X version too ..

After using too many kexts installer which gave me some strange issues especially in Yosemite and is the reason behind creating this tool .

I created for personal use and thought I’d share with you  here.

Simply drop one or several kexts on the window or dock icon and let Easy Kext do the rest.
